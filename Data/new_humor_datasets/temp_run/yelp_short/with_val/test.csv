Beautiful food presentation.  Great taste.  Consistently excellent.

Will deliver to your hotel if you stay at the Staybridge Suites (which is best hotel choice in the area by the way)

All of the Outback take away servers were Warm, friendly, kind and professional.  They are always appreciative of your business and take the time to say thank you.

At the risk of sounding full of myself my Mac and Cheese is better. Also their burnt end beans were too heavy on the mustard for me. My kids dug their shoe string fries. I'll definitely go back for the meat. Maybe I'll give the coleslaw a try.","I'll go back. Got a lb of brisket and a lb of pulled pork. Both were very very yummy.

-Cigar City Brewing in Tampa is okay.
-Coming from the West Coast, your taste buds and brewery experiences tend to have a very high-standard.

-Inside the taproom, there are two bars, one as soon as you walk inside and the slightly bigger one in the back.
-There's also a small gift shop.

Overall, this is an average brewery in my novice opinion.","In A Nutshell:

This hidden gem in Edgehill Village offers up a fresh perspective in the Nashville bar scene. From the carefully crafted cocktails to the gorgeous nod to Art Deco decor, you will be finding every excuse in the book to plot your next visit here. Plus, I love the #grrrlpower of the Soler sisters who founded and executed this top notch establishment. Come now, come often.

I recommend splitting the chicken or cochon Benedict unless you're a linebacker for the Saints.

The deviled egg sandwiches were really good. I'm really picky when it comes to egg sandwiches because I make some great egg salad myself but these didn't disappoint. Each sandwich came with a pickle and chips.

I take my dogs to this location for their grooming and they've always done an amazing job with them.  The few concerns about the store is it's really not laid out very well for the amount of foot traffic they receive and there never seems to be enough help at the cash registers.

3551,I was very disappointed with my recent stay here. I've been quite happy with SPG/Aloft hotels normally but this Aloft was just awful. The entire facility was poorly kept and generally dirty. The occupants of the neighboring room were up until the early morning (3am) smoking & drinking inside/outside their room. The staff conveyed overall apathy and did little to nothing as a result.

Super bland, luke-warm food. The salad had parsley in it and no asparagus as it said it did.

I'm also confused because the menu on their website has many more options than their menu in the restaurant.

Not enforcing facemasks or social distancing is unacceptable. Their lack of enforcing mandatory health and safety regulations means I will gladly take my (and my guests') money elsewhere.",funny,1
6175,Okay. So I ordered soup and a side of meatballs from Ralph from Caviar. There's a spot on the order page where you can make a request. I asked for extra Parmesan and a spare square of toilet paper. I added that I was joking. They included a roll of tp with my order. I FUCKING LIVE Ralph's.,Okay.

13369,"Golf N'stuff, can't get enough.... haha, the commercial from years ago still plays in my head when I think about this place.

Go karts, bumper boats, video games, prizes, mini golf... you really can't get enough at Golf N'stuff!! 

Perfect to take the kids for an afternoon of family fun, go on a silly mini golf date as an adult, or for any one else really. It's simple, good, fun.","Golf N'stuff, can't get enough.... haha, the commercial from years ago still plays in my head when I think about this place.

Great lunch spot, eat outside on a sunny day!","Salads are delish, although a bit pricey at $7.75 a pop. I felt the healthful salad eating justified a cookie though, and damn was that money well spent. They do baked goods and coffeehouse drinks, as well as bread-y and salad-y treats very well.

If you want someone who knows how to cut hair, don't come here. I don't understand what is so difficult to understand about ""Layered Bob"". It's a standard hairstyle that is taught during training.","Just left there and even with a $10 coupon I was still charged $19 for a horrible haircut.
