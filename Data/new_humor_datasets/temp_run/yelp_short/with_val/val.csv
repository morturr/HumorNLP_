It's really a somewhat bizarre little hipsteresque ice cream shop with very high prices. I appreciate that they let you try lots of flavours, and some of them are really good.

The three sides I had were spectacular, really, and I had a hard time narrowing it down. Every single item was good and hearty without skewing into too sweet or too sour. Their chess pie was spectacular, and the sweet tea was perfectly made.

I consider myself as a BBQ snob after growing up by Kansas City. I came for dinner and was lucky enough to still try the brisket. It was perfect. Just the right smoked flavor, rub and tender!!! I gave this place a five just bc of the brisket. The sides where meh and corn bread was a bit dry but good flavor. I highly recommend stopping here if you're ever in the area, but beware if you are coming for Brisket it is sold primarily for lunch and ribs for dinner.",not funny,0

Love it or hate it - the Blue dog is iconic...  Is it earth shattering art?  Depends on how you look at it I suppose.  Frankly I am a fan and have a few Blue Dogs scattered around the place in various stages of framing.

The gallery is perfect for the works that he does and I've never been hassled there - so that works for me.

Aside from the various Blue Dogs, Rodrigue also does other types of work, mostly with a Louisiana theme involved.

British food has had a bad rap over the years and now Stargazy gives a legitimate reason to shelve those notions. Get the pie and mash special. The parsley ""liquor"" gravy is out of this world. There is a cauliflower pie as well for the vegetarians. It's also great. I also like the selection of unusual sodas and the cranberry dessert pie is delicious.",funny,1

Another reviewer called her miserable, but it may simply be lack of training or being put in a position that is too difficult for her. Maybe she can 'shadow' one of the much younger employees to learn skills needed to be a cashier?","The older lady may not be ready to work as a cashier.

Solid mac & cheese, fried catfish, and chicken & dumplings.

A bit pricey, but quality of eats made it A-OK! If you're looking for a more low-key spot for a relaxing meal away from the normal craziness of the French Quarter this is a decent choice.

Very clean unisex bathroom too. Always a plus.","Kind of a fancy pants looking spot, but when we walked in and heard some great 80's new wave playing on the speakers there was no way we could not eat here.
